# Network Traffic Analysis using Pandas

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow using Python and Pandas on real-world network traffic data. The focus is on data exploration, cleaning, and feature-level analysis using reproducible practices.

## Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) and contains labelled network traffic records, including benign and attack traffic.

Raw data is not included in this repository.

## Project Structure
- notebooks/ : step-by-step analysis notebooks
- src/ : reusable data utility functions
